# Note: 
# For clusterIP:None (aka headless service), read this:
#    https://medium.com/faun/kubernetes-headless-service-vs-clusterip-and-traffic-distribution-904b058f0dfd
# In short: If you are using a single pod like a database server(mysql,pgsql), 
#    you can use headless service. 
#    But if you are going to run multiple pods for a service, 
#    it is better to create clusterIP type kubernetes service.
# ClusterIP:none creates necessary DNS entries for a service, 
#                and, these entries have proper backend pointing to the backend containers,
#                but, there is no load balancing.
# type:ClusterIP creates same as above, but also provides load balancing between multiple backends.
